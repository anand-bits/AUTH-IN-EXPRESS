## Introduction

User_auth is a Node.js application that provides user authentication functionalities. It allows users to register for accounts, authenticate their identity, and manage their profile information.

## Features

- User registration (Sign Up)
- User authentication (Sign In)
- User profile management (Login)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- Git (optional)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the User_auth application.

### Installation

1. Clone the User_auth repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anand-bits/Auth In Express.git
   cd User_auth
   ## After Installation

After you've successfully installed the User_auth application, you can proceed with the following steps:

 **Configuration**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and configure your environment variables. Use the provided template in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
Login
To access a user's profile information, send a GET request to the /api/login endpoint with a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
### Login

To access a user's profile information, follow these steps:

1. **Authentication**:

   - First, a user must be authenticated to obtain an authentication token. Refer to the [Sign In](#sign-in) section for details on how to obtain the authentication token.

2. **Accessing Profile Information**:

   - After successfully signing in and receiving an authentication token, you can use this token to access a user's profile information.

3. **Making a GET Request**:

   - Make a `GET` request to the `/api/login` endpoint with the valid JWT token included in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request.

   - Example using curl:

     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/login -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"
     ```

4. **Response**:

   - If the JWT token is valid, the application will respond with the user's profile information in JSON format.

   - Example response:

     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "123456",
       "username": "exampleuser",
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "other_fields": "..."
     }
     ```

5. **Authorization Error**:

   - If the provided JWT token is invalid, expired, or missing, the application will respond with an authorization error. Ensure that you have a valid token before making the `GET` request.

Please note that accessing a user's profile information is a protected endpoint and requires a valid JWT token for authentication.

**Note**: You can customize the returned user profile fields and response format according to your project's specific requirements.

By following these steps, you can successfully retrieve a user's profile information after they have been authenticated.
